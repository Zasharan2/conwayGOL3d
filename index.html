            <span id = "explanationText">In this project, I coded a 3D extension to the classic Conway's Game of Life (GOL).<br><br>Here's how it works:<br>When the project loads, you are greeted with a beautiful purple (magenta?) title screen.<br>The settings button allows you to choose the number of dimensions. This is by default 2.<br><br>The 2D GOL rules remain the same:<br>1&#41; A living cell continues to the next generation if and only if it has 2 or 3 live cells next to it, otherwise it dies.<br>2&#41; A dead cell becomes live if it has exactly 3 live cells next to it.<br>Being "next to" a cell in 2D simply means to be one of the 8 cells that are immediately adjacent or diagonal a cell.<br><br>In 3D GOL, the rules are:<br>1&#41; A living cell continues to the next generation if and only if it has 9, 10, or 11 live cells next to it, otherwise it dies.<br>2&#41; A dead cell becomes live if it has exactly 10 live cells next to it.<br>Being "next to" a cell in 3D simply means to be one of the 26 cells that are immediately adjacent or diagonal a cell.<br><br>When playing, left click a tile to turn it live, and right click to kill it.<br>In 3D GOL, there are indicators on the left and right as for what z-dimension you are in.<br>Navigate the z-dimension with up and down arrow keys, or with the W and S keys.<br>Press space to advance to the next generation.<br><br>And that's it! Have fun making cool stuff in 3D GOL! (Board size currently limited to 20x20x20, might change)</span>
