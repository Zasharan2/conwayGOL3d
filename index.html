            <span id = "explanationText">In this project, I coded a 3D extension to the classic Conway's Game of Life (GOL).<br><br>Here's how it works:<br>When the project loads, you are greeted with a beautiful purple (magenta?) title screen.<br>The settings button allows you to choose the number of dimensions. This is by default 2.<br>You may also choose your ruleset in the settings. To understand what they mean:<br>The number(s) after the B indicate how many tiles need to be next to one for it to turn dead to alive.<br>The number(s) after the S indicate how many tiles need to be next to one for it to remain alive.<br>Numbers with 2 or more digits are in brackets to reduce confusion.<br>(eg. (12) to denote the full number of 12 instead of 12 which would mean 1 or 2)<br><br>Being "next to" a cell in 2D simply means to be one of the 8 cells that are immediately adjacent or diagonal a cell.<br>Being "next to" a cell in 3D simply means to be one of the 26 cells that are immediately adjacent or diagonal a cell.<br><br>When playing, left click a tile to turn it live, and right click to kill it.<br>In 3D GOL, there are indicators on the left and right as for what z-dimension you are in.<br>Navigate the z-dimension with up and down arrow keys, or with the W and S keys.<br>Press space to advance to the next generation.<br><br>And that's it! Have fun making cool stuff in 3D GOL! (Board size currently limited to 20x20x20, might change)</span>
